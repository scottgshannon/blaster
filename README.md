A simple rust tool for load testing a single endpoint.

# Why?

I had concerns about how a single endpoint would handle large amounts of direct connections.

# Can I use it?

Sure!... as long as you recognize this is one person's hacked-together tool for their specific use case with no care if it bricked their system.  No warranty, no guarantee, not even a pinky promise that it won't fail miserably when you use it.
